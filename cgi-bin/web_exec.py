# Executes the Online Python Tutor back-end as a CGI script, which
# accepts one POST parameter, 'user_script', containing the string
# contents of the Python script that the user wants to execute.
#
# Returns a complete JSON execution trace to the front-end.
#
# This version uses Python 2.5 on the MIT CSAIL servers.
# (note that Python 2.4 doesn't work on CSAIL, but Python 2.5 does)
#
# If you want to run this script, then you'll need to change the
# shebang line at the top of this file to point to your system's Python.
#
# Also, check CGI execute permission in your script directory.
# You might need to create an .htaccess file like the following:
#
#   Options +ExecCGI
#   AddHandler cgi-script .py


# set to true if you want to log queries in DB_FILE 
LOG_QUERIES = False # don't do logging for now
